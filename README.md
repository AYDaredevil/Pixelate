# Pixelate
The aim was to collect various colored boxes using a code driven grabbing mechanism and
to place them according to given scheme which was changing stochastically.
So for that different codes are written in matlab, main codes are of adjacency matrix and that of
dijkshtra algorithm.
Images were taken from the webcam placed over arena.
And on them image processing was done.
Steps 
1. Current Color Detection
2. Treating Arena as graph
3. Finding nearest node using Djikshtra
4. Grabbing Box
5. Taking it to required Position
